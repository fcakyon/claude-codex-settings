# Load Frontend Design Skill

Load the frontend-design skill from Anthropic's official Claude Code plugins to guide creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces.

Try to read the skill content using GitHub MCP if available:

- owner: anthropics
- repo: claude-code
- path: plugins/frontend-design/skills/frontend-design/SKILL.md

If GitHub MCP is not available, fetch from:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anthropics/claude-code/main/plugins/frontend-design/skills/frontend-design/SKILL.md

Use this guidance when building web components, pages, or applications that require high design quality and avoid generic AI aesthetics.
