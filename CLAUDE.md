# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## AI Guidance

* After receiving tool results, carefully reflect on their quality and determine optimal next steps before proceeding. Use your thinking to plan and iterate based on this new information, and then take the best next action.
* For maximum efficiency, whenever you need to perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially.
* Before you finish, please verify your solution
* Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
* NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
* ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
* NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.
* When you update or modify core context files, also update markdown documentation and memory bank
* When asked to commit changes, exclude CLAUDE.md and CLAUDE-*.md referenced memory bank system files from any commits.

## Memory Bank System

This project uses a structured memory bank system with specialized context files. Always check these files for relevant information before starting work:

### Core Context Files

* **CLAUDE-activeContext.md** - Current session state, goals, and progress (if exists)
* **CLAUDE-patterns.md** - Established code patterns and conventions (if exists)
* **CLAUDE-decisions.md** - Architecture decisions and rationale (if exists)
* **CLAUDE-troubleshooting.md** - Common issues and proven solutions (if exists)
* **CLAUDE-config-variables.md** - Configuration variables reference (if exists)
* **CLAUDE-temp.md** - Temporary scratch pad (only read when referenced)

**Important:** Always reference the active context file first to understand what's currently being worked on and maintain session continuity.
